  <p id="right-inner" class="well text-well">Most movies lose money but some make profits 
  in the hundreds of millions, be they dollars, euro or pounds. In India movies have become 
  an enormous part of the economy. The industry has always been dominated by a few major 
  movie studios like MGM/UA, Warner Bros. ,Columbia, Lucasfilm, Paramount or Disney. There 
  are many large companies that provide all of the services needed to make movies, such as 
  special effects, lighting, set building. Many of these employees belong to trade unions 
  who say how much their members must be paid. A huge number of smaller companies also offer 
  services, such as music studios (which record the music for original movie sound tracks) 
  and CGI computer animation. Finally there are movie distribution companies (which send 
  movies around the world or around a country), and advertising companies who let people know 
  about the movie and promote it (try to make people want to see the movie).<br><br>Movies with 
  famous stars and large budgets (lots of money), are designed to have a wide appeal, so that 
  hopefully millions of people will pay to see them. These most expensive movies are called 
  blockbusters. Special effects can add a huge amount to the cost of a movie, especially the 
  newest CGI effects, but people have come to expect them and every blockbuster movie tries to 
  out-do the last. Even in 2008, some movies cost up to $200 million to make. Very successful 
  movies can make many times that amount in profit, and that's why the studios keep producing 
  them. This kind of movie will have a lot of promotion through television advertising, 
  billboards and internet sites. In blockbuster movies, there is usually a happy ending, in 
  which all of the problems in the plot (story) are figured out or fixed and almost everyone 
  (except the baddie) live happily ever after. Some movies have been so successful that the 
  studios keep releasing more and more sequels, or movies with the same characters and basic 
  plots.<br><br>At the opposite end of the scale to the blockbuster, there is the independent, 
  art, or Indie movie. These are usually made by small movie companies, or even just a small 
  group of people that do not have much money. An example is The Blair Witch Project, which 
  cost only about $60,000, but which has so far taken perhaps $200 million in ticket and DVD 
  sales. Movies like this are very unusual and usually become popular 'underground' (word of 
  mouth advertising), so that they become cult, or popular but not mainstream. Independent 
  movies often tell more creative or unusual (strange) stories, or may have sad endings that 
  do not appeal to the big studios, because they can not be sure how the public will react to 
  them. They rarely make a lot of money, but if they are successful, the big studios will 
  quickly try to get the people involved to sign a contract with them, by offering them a lot 
  of money to make another movie. Often the new movie, with its big budget and its stars will 
  be less successful than the first.
